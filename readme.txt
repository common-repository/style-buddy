Add custom css and javascript to a page via the WordPress administration panel. Code is only loaded on the page to which it was added.

== Description ==

Dealing with theme styles can be a hassle, but Style Buddy makes editing your WordPress site a breeze! 

When the plugin is activated each page, post (and every other WordPress custom post type) gets metaboxes that allow you to add custom javascript and css to only that particular item. Let's say you want to change the background color of your home page to black, but still want all your other pages to have a white background. With Style Buddy you just edit your homepage and add a command like body{background-color:black;} and only your home page background color will be changed.

Javascript is just as easy. Simply select the page or post you want, add your javascript to the specified metabox and you're ready to go!

== Installation ==

Delete any old installations of the plugin. Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

Once the plugin is activated navigate to Settings > Style Buddy. Select your options, save and you're ready to go. It's that easy!
